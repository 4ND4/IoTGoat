# 
The IoTGoat Project is a deliberately insecure firmware based on OpenWrt. The projectâ€™s goal is to teach users about the most common vulnerabilities typically found in IoT devices. The vulnerabilities will be based on the IoT Top 10 as documented by OWASP: https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Internet_of_Things_Project.

To get started with developing IoTGoat challenges, review the [Build Environment Guidance](BuildEnvironment.md) page. Precompiled firmware and an OVA with the latest build can be found via https://github.com/scriptingxss/IoTGoat/tree/master/build_environment. If a crucial challenge idea is missing, please reach out to the project leaders below  or add details to the [project task page](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1KXX2K7ikkve6wmdfAVu-sZONgKEBuAkRij_paJUgX2w/edit?usp=sharing). Be sure to join the [OWASP Slack team](https://join.slack.com/t/owasp/shared_invite/enQtNDI5MzgxMDQ2MTAwLTEyNzIzYWQ2NDZiMGIwNmJhYzYxZDJiNTM0ZmZiZmJlY2EwZmMwYjAyNmJjNzQxNzMyMWY4OTk3ZTQ0MzFhMDY), then join the **#iot-security** for news on upcoming project meetings and updates.
